       "The convergence of our physical and digital ecosystems continues to revolutionize our lives, reshape our behaviors, and reimagine our ability to navigate the complex beauty and challenges of life in a boundaryless world. Radical technological innovations have resulted in a fundamental mindset shift of our behaviors, needs, and desires, moving from Live, Work, Play (and Shop), to a hybrid of **Live, Live, Live**.\n",
       "\n",
       "While many of us feel Covid-19 is largely in the rearview mirror, unfortunately a tapestry of global social epidemics still affects us all. Americans are lonelier than ever: [according to the Cigna U.S. Loneliness Index](https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look), 58% of adults, and 79% of those aged 18-24 report being lonely. Our social networks are a third smaller now and we’re far more likely to live alone; today, nearly 28% of U.S. homes have just one occupant, up from 17% in 1969 according to the US Census. The annual number of marriages is in decline, and birth rates are slowing. In a lonelier, more divided world, the need for community is greater than ever.\n",
       "\n",
       "There’s a lot to consider with this cascade of change occurring at the speed of culture. As landlords, developers, and designers collaborate for a better future, we need to start thinking differently. It is not enough to simply evolve the concept of our built environment. Since we now live a hybridized life, we need to make a transformative shift to a “New Hybrid” experience, one that can play a significant role in restoring our sense of closeness in our communities. The New Hybrid experience is a model that uses an integrative approach to the disciplines of art, science, and technology, helping us to develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of our modern world and guide us to produce positive and impactful outcomes.\n",
       "\n",
       "The New Hybrid experience brings together the robust attributes of commerce, culture, and leisure, and recalibrates the urban experience. It is amenity rich, leverages technology, connects easily to transit, and offers world-class leisure and event activities. It promotes local artisans and culture, reflects generational and community values, and builds traditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "We relate to urban environments in an emotional dimension. Signature characteristics of hybrid places — otherwise called mixed use — are personable and human-centric. The value proposition is when a space, a place, a building, or an event **moves** us. When this happens, it elicits a sense of awe and wonder, engages all of our senses, dissolves barriers, and eliminates pain points.\n",
       "\n",
       "The emotional exchange between the built environment and the user is about attaining and retaining a person’s attention. It’s that visceral moment when something inside you connects with the place in a special way, the beyond ordinary life experience that can elicit an emotional response that requires no specialized knowledge, nothing more than one’s emotion to make it happen. And it happens to everyone. Great places have a defined persona, which has the ability to trigger aesthetic emotions — that highly emotive sense you get, which can sometimes be difficult to describe, but you just know it just feels amazing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here are some examples of how the New Hybrid is playing out in our project work across multiple scales:\n",
       "\n",
       "For [The Hub on Causeway](https://www.gensler.com/projects/the-hub-on-causeway), a dynamic, 2-million-square-foot mixed-use development at Boston’s TD Garden, Gensler created a marquee sports and entertainment destination with office, residential, hotel, retail, entertainment, dining, and creative office space that culminates in a grand entrance that funnels people to TD Garden and the North Station transit hub.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is an exterior view of TD Garden and North Station in Boston at dusk, featuring illuminated signage, pedestrian walkways, and traffic on the surrounding streets.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Hub on Causeway, Boston, Massachusetts. Photo by Anton Grassl.\n",
       "\n",
       "On a smaller scale, Gensler transformed a former meeting and convention space into the Sportsmen’s Lodge, an upscale outdoor lifestyle center in LA’s Studio City with 95,700-square-feet of walkable retail, restaurants, fitness, and public space. An open-air plaza features communal spaces for visitors to dine or relax, while a waterfront deck hosts tenant and center events.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is an outdoor public space with tables and chairs for dining, a modern building, lush greenery, and people walking and enjoying the ambiance.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Sportsmen’s Lodge, Los Angeles, California\n",
       "\n",
       "**Designed for maximum happiness, the New Hybrid is a magnetic and transformational place that transcends the predictable**. An amazing hybrid experience creates cultural capital by truly caring for us and improves the way we are. If our lives are truly enriched, the place will be more than real estate — it creates a deep, emotional connection with us and truly becomes an integral part of our lives.\n",

As a researcher, I love uncovering surprises in the data that debunk common perceptions. These surprising truths often lead to a new understanding of how people work and what they value, as well as new insights on the built environment. In [our latest workplace research](https://www.gensler.com/gri/us-workplace-survey-2022) study, we saw a number of unexpected surprises!\\n\\nHere are the top three surprises uncovered in our research impacting the return to the office:\\n\\n## Surprise #1: A Shift in the Role of the Office\\n\\nGensler conducted 11 different workplace research studies during the pandemic to understand how work and employee expectations were changing and what it meant for the new role of the office. In our surveys, we asked office workers and senior leaders to choose their top five most important reasons to come into the office. Throughout the pandemic the top-ranked reason was to \\u201cwork in-person with my team/colleagues.\\u201d This was the top reason in all six countries that we surveyed \\u2014 the United States, U.K., France, Australia, India, and even China, where people had already returned after their first big wave of COVID cases. It was the top reason segmented by 10 different industries, as well as by generation.\\n\\nOur latest [U.S. Workplace Survey](https://www.gensler.com/gri/us-workplace-survey-2022) research was conducted in the late summer of 2022 as people were returning to the office. Like all of Gensler\\u2019s workplace research since 2008, we surveyed only office workers who spend at least part of their time in the office. This time, when we asked over 2,000 respondents to choose their top five most important reasons to come into the office, there was a sudden shift in the role of the office. The new top reason was to \\u201cfocus on my work.\\u201d When we look at the top five or six important reasons, we see that people ranked access to technology, specific spaces, materials, and resources high, as well as scheduled in-person meetings with their team and sitting with their team. There was a shift from working with my team, connecting, and socializing to the broader purpose of simply getting their work done. Focus on my work was particularly important for the younger generations.\\n\\n## Surprise #2: Employees Say They NEED to Work in the Office More Often\\n\\nIn our latest North America surveys, conducted late summer 2022, U.S. employees report that they are spending 51% of a typical work week in the office. The balance of the week is spent working in other locations, business travel, coworking sites, third places, home. Time spent at the office varies by location, with government/defense and consumer goods industries spending the most time at the office and media and energy industries spending the least.\\n\\nIn the survey, we not only asked how much time respondents are **currently** in the office but also how much time they **ideally need** to work in their company\\u2019s office space to maximize their individual and team productivity. This was our second surprise: employees report that they need to spend more time at the office to maximize their productivity! And the top quartile of the U.S. innovative companies we surveyed say they need to work in the office 67% of the work week, which is the exact same percentage we measured before the start of the pandemic in February 2020.\\n\\nWe got a double surprise when we looked at productivity. Through the pandemic, people had reported that working from home was both efficient and highly productive. Our research hypothesis was that people would say that the office is more important for team productivity than individual productivity. But we found that both were equally important. In fact, U.S. office workers in high-performing workplaces report that they need to be in the office 72% of the work week to maximize individual productivity and 71% of the week to maximize team productivity. It was no surprise that employees who work in low-performing workspaces say they need to be in the office 6% less than they are currently coming in.\\n\\nThis begs the question of why. If employees say they **need** to work in the office to maximize individual and team productivity, why aren\\u2019t they coming into the office? What\\u2019s holding them back? We sense part of the answer may be [why they are returning](https://www.gensler.com/blog/what-gensler-workplace-survey-reveals-about-return-to-office), as well as understanding [what is working](https://www.gensler.com/blog/return-to-the-workplace-what-works-what-doesnt) and what doesn\\u2019t when they do spend time at the office. Our last surprise may also be part of the answer.\\n\\n## Surprise #3: A New Mix of Experiences Would Bring Employees Back Even More\\n\\nFinally, we wanted to explore what\\u2019s missing in the current workplace that would bring more employees back to the office. In a survey, it\\u2019s difficult to ask over 2,000 office workers across 10 industries what they wished they had at the office if they don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s possible. So, we described eight everyday experiences that people could easily relate with, ranging from a library to a coffee shop to a clubhouse. Respondents could select various experiences and toggle each to create a pie chart of their ideal mix of work experiences. As we analyzed the data, we saw some interesting patterns by industry and by generation.\\n\\nHowever, we got a big surprise when we asked the question, \\u201cIf your company provided your ideal work experience mix, would you be willing to coming to your company\\u2019s office more often?\\u201d In response, 42% say they would be willing to come in one more day/week, 17% say one more day/month, and 24% say they would be willing to return full-time! That\\u2019s 83% of employees who aren\\u2019t already full-time in the office. Younger generations report a greater willingness to return to the office for their ideal mix of work experiences.\\n\\nResearch on people and the built environment is an investment in our future. Research not only informs our projects and our work to make it better, but we can also learn from our projects to inform the next cycle of research. Surprises in research data are a gift as they can catalyze deeper conversations with our clients to understand how their employees work and the role that the built environment can play to not only support better work performance but enrich people\\u2019s lives and experiences. Surprises lead to deeper explorations and new insights, which fuel the power of design to imagine new possibilities!\\n\\nFor media inquiries, email [media@gensler.com](https://www.gensler.com/blog/).\"\n",

Photo by Ryan Gobuty.\\n\\n*Editor\\u2019s note: This article was originally published in [Work Design Magazine](https://www.workdesign.com/2025/02/informal-collaboration-space/).*\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the pandemic and the resulting shift to remote and hybrid work models, many organizations have reduced their real estate footprint, in some cases, significantly. Today, as more and more companies look to increase office presence for employees, they are having to rethink their workplace strategies to accommodate a greater daily population.\\n\\nThey\\u2019re grappling with whether to lease more space or repurpose shared space to accommodate increased demand for workstations and offices. This dilemma is a microcosm of broader organizational challenges that often pit financial considerations against employee needs and cultural implications.\\n\\n## Why Collaboration Space Increased as Footprints Decreased\\n\\nThe pandemic prompted a paradigm shift in how offices are used. The purpose of the office was less about individual work and more about interactive work. Traditional cubicles gave way to more open, collaboration-focused layouts with minimal shared individual space types. Meeting rooms increased in number and variety, and breakout spaces, huddle rooms, and lounge areas became the focal points, designed to foster interaction and innovation while accommodating a workforce that spent significant time working remotely.\\n\\nThis shift was a strategic response to changing work patterns, but also one that delivered efficiency. Repurposing underutilized individual space to collaboration space aligned the workplace to a hybrid and remote workforce while still leaving a significant amount of excess space that could be shed, saving businesses often millions of dollars in overhead costs while also signaling a commitment to flexibility.\\n\\nThis is an open, modern office space with a concrete floor and ceiling, exposed pipes, diverse seating arrangements including sofas, chairs, and counter seating by a window, and architectural elements such as archways and built-in shelving.\\n\\nEdelman\\u2019s Los Angeles office features a variety of casual collaboration areas for coworking and client meetings. The first-floor cafe is dedicated to communal workspaces with multiple seating options and an adjacent terrace. Photo by Ryan Gobuty.\\n\\n## The Conundrum\\n\\nFast-forward to today. Many organizations find they\\u2019ve painted themselves into a corner.\\n\\nAs policies shift to increase days in the office, workplaces that had been downsized are running into capacity issues, especially on peak office days. The mix of spaces designed for a remote workforce \\u2014 mostly focused on collaboration \\u2014 are short on seats to accommodate individual work.\\n\\nThe almost default solution companies are taking to solve this problem is to repurpose open collaboration space into individual workstations and small enclosed meeting rooms and huddle rooms into private offices. It seems like a harmless trade-off, and maybe even an improvement in terms of informal collaboration spaces, which are often not highly used and may sit empty for a good portion of the day.\\n\\nFrom a financial standpoint, this approach makes sense. It allows businesses to manage the influx of employees without taking on more space. While lower than before the pandemic, commercial real estate costs are still high, and economic uncertainty makes committing to new leases a risk many organizations would like to avoid. On its face, repurposing existing collaboration spaces to individual space seems like a win-win solution: a cost-effective way to accommodate more employees while maintaining financial discipline.\\n\\nThe image shows a contemporary office space featuring a built-in booth with seating for two beneath a curved alcove adorned with a decorative pattern, adjacent to a wall with a mounted television and a glass-enclosed office with a person walking past.\\n\\nBooth seating in BDO\\u2019s New York office provides a flexible option for casual meetings and breaks. Photo by Gensler/Gillian Fry.\\n\\n## Why It\\u2019s the Wrong Solution\\n\\nThe root of the problem with the prevailing solution \\u2014 repurposing \\u201cwe\\u201d space to \\u201cme\\u201d space \\u2014 is that it\\u2019s missing the whole point behind repopulating the office: companies want people back in the office so they can collaborate more, so they can interact more, so they can learn and grow from and with each other. Decreasing the space types that allow and encourage collaboration and interaction to happen, and putting in more individual seats is working against the goal, not for it. It\\u2019s self-defeating.\\n\\nThat in itself is problematic, but it\\u2019s also a quick way to frustrate people, many of whom may already be resistant to new office presence requirements. \\u201cIf my team is just going to sit at our desks doing Zoom calls because we can\\u2019t find a collaboration space, why not just stay home?\\u201d\\n\\nA company\\u2019s desire to increase in-person collaboration is not capricious. There is ample research proving in-person teams are more collaborative, more cohesive, and that they come up with better solutions. Physical presence allows for better non-verbal communication, immediate interaction, and deeper relationships. Virtual meetings are more transactional, less productive, less engaging (some estimates put the percentage of people who multitask during virtual meetings as high as 92%), and simply less enjoyable. As the essayist Sarah Robinson so aptly puts it, a video conference call is \\u201clike eating without tasting.\\u201d It checks the box on meeting but is entirely unsatisfying.\\n\\nThe workplace environment communicates with the people within it, both consciously and subconsciously. Incorporating collaboration spaces of different sizes and types, open and closed, tells people that collaboration is valued and encouraged by the organization. Proximity and ample availability make collaboration easy to do, and more likely to happen. Just as a store putting gum near the checkout counter makes it more likely a person will buy it, putting collaboration spaces throughout the work floor makes it more likely a person is going to collaborate.\\n\\nThis is a modern office space with a lounge area featuring a large sectional sofa, a long work table with chairs, and enclosed meeting rooms with glass walls.\\n\\nA mix of small conference rooms, soft seating, and collaboration tables break up the floor plate of United Airlines\\u2019 Amenity Hub. Photo by Connie Zhou.\\n\\n## A Defining Moment\\n\\nWhile repurposing collaboration space into individual space offers an easy, relatively inexpensive short-term fix, the long-term implications are less positive. The motivation behind a shift to more in-office presence is to have more in-person collaboration. Decreasing space types that support collaboration undermines the very goal bringing people back into the office is trying to achieve.\\n\\nFor decades workplace design has operated on an \\u201ceither/or\\u201d approach, where increases in one area \\u2014 more amenities, support spaces, and collaboration spaces \\u2014 come at the sacrifice of others, usually individual space. This next era needs to embrace a \\u201cboth/and\\u201d approach. Creating environments that superlatively support both individual focus work and rich collaborative work will deliver better experiences and stronger cultures, and ultimately, positive business performance outcomes.\\n\\nInvesting in additional space now, even with associated costs, is a strategic move to avoid regressing to office models from the 1990s that stifled innovation and collaboration. By expanding thoughtfully and intentionally, companies can maintain modern, flexible work environments that foster creativity and productivity.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s not revert to the problems of the past. Let\\u2019s embrace forward-thinking strategies that enhance our workplaces and drive future success.\\n\\nFor media inquiries, email [media@gensler.com](https://www.gensler.com/blog/).\"\n",

Photo by Chad Mellon.\\n\\nThe real estate industry is in a time of great uncertainty with volatile inflation and interest rates, rising construction costs, major geopolitical events, and social and economic futures that feel unpredictable. Similar to how the past several years created opportunities to fundamentally rethink how we live, work, and interact with our communities and the built environment, the current upheaval is a chance for us to continue to adapt and innovate.\\n\\nAmid all the ambiguity, the one type of development that has been thriving is mixed-use environments, which are key to reviving our communities\\u2019 urban centers. As traditional single-use spaces like office parks and retail centers struggle to get back to pre-pandemic occupancy rates, mixed-use projects present more optimal returns on investment for developers, since they lease for higher values and are more flexible to pivot during economic downturns.\\n\\nMixed-use environments also play an integral role in the revitalization of our cities because they are designed to be experience driven. By serving diverse populations and a wider range of functions, they create dynamic and inclusive spaces that people want to be part of. As we look to the future of the built environment, mixed-use projects are pivotal in making our communities more enjoyable and resilient.\\n\\nHere are four principles for creating mixed-use environments that will future proof your real estate:\\n\\n## 1\\\\. Design for curated experiences.\\n\\nDesign improvements can turn monoculture environments like the workplace into [experience multipliers](https://www.gensler.com/blog/how-to-make-your-office-an-experience-multiplier). Through the lens of creating intentional user journeys, the development becomes a destination rather than an obligation.\\n\\nExperience-driven, mixed-use environments appeal to people\\u2019s desire for connection in a post-pandemic world, where residents are increasingly drawn to environments that reflect their communities in an authentic way, layering culture, history, and activities for a better experience.\\n\\nThis is a high-angle, eye-level shot of a brightly lit outdoor shopping center at dusk, featuring modern architecture, palm trees wrapped in lights, and an Erewhon store, with cars parked in the foreground and a hillside residential area in the background.\\n\\nSportsmen\\u2019s Lodge. Los Angeles, California\\n\\n## 2\\\\. Encourage 24/7 activation.\\n\\nA diversity of experiences and constituents is supported by programming, which should attract people at different times of the day. By encouraging inter-generational, civic, and cultural use of a space, you ensure that the asset is active at all times. This intensity of site use also leads to higher rent rates, lower vacancies, and faster occupancy.\\n\\nMunicipalities have been actively rethinking zoning codes and other requirements that segregated building uses in the past, allowing for more adaptive reuse in locations that were once single use.\\n\\nThis is an eye-level, wide outdoor shot of an urban entertainment district at dusk, featuring a brick-and-glass building complex with lighted restaurant signs and pedestrian walkways, people strolling about, and a blue-glass skyscraper as a backdrop.\\n\\nAssembly Food Hall, Fifth + Broadway, Nashville, Tennessee. Photo by Garrett Rowland.\\n\\n## 3\\\\. Prioritize flexibility and resilience.\\n\\nDesigning for resilience means creating environments that are suited to how we work and live, two variables that are constantly changing. In a time of uncertainty, resiliency in the built environment is defined by places that are adaptable and can change over time. These types of mixed-use communities present better return on investment for developers, and offer more possibilities during downturns.\\n\\nThe image depicts a vibrant, modern cityscape with multi-story buildings featuring glass facades and greenery on their roofs, set around a park-like area where people are engaged in various activities such as walking, sitting, and playing.\\n\\nMission Point, Santa Clara, California\\n\\n## 4\\\\. Provide a community space.\\n\\nDesignating spaces for community gatherings will help make the development feel like an extension of the neighborhood. At LinkedIn\\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco, the lobby features glass wall panels that slide back, making room for internal events, as well as community gatherings. By creating a space within the office that encourages interaction with the community at large, the development is integrated into the community and cultivates a more welcoming atmosphere.\\n\\nThis image shows a modern, mixed-use development with a large, glass-paneled building overlooking a pedestrian plaza featuring seating areas, landscaping, and a lower level with colorful mural art.\\n\\nWest Edge, Los Angeles, California. Photo by Jason O\\u2019Rear.\\n\\n## Connecting to the urban fabric\\n\\nFrom workspaces to urban centers, these mixed use principles can be scaled across projects and locations. Not only do they create environments that are more equitable and enjoyable, but they are also proof that single-use buildings are not necessarily dead \\u2014 they just need to be connected to the urban fabric around them for a more heterogeneous environment.\\n\\nSpaces for gatherings and spontaneous interactions have never been more important. In a world of escalating construction costs and uncertainty about the future, mixed-use developments appeal to our need for connection and create a sense of belonging, helping developers, designers, and occupants alike to transcend the uncertainty of the moment.\\n\\nFor media inquiries, email [media@gensler.com](https://www.gensler.com/blog/).\"\n",

We sat down with [Andre Brumfield](https://www.gensler.com/people/andre-brumfield), [Ian Mulcahey](https://www.gensler.com/people/ian-mulcahey), and [Chris Rzomp](https://www.gensler.com/people/christopher-rzomp), global leaders of Gensler\\u2019s [Cities & Urban Design practice](https://www.gensler.com/expertise/cities-urban-design), to discuss what\\u2019s next for the future of cities.*\\n\\n## Many downtowns are struggling in the wake of the pandemic, and clients want to know how to invest effectively. How are you advising them? And how long do you think it will take for cities to fully bounce back from the pandemic?\\n\\n**Andre Brumfield:** It\\u2019s going to be a process that\\u2019s going to unfold for some cities in the next five years, while others may take a decade or generation to do so. Downtowns have died and come back for centuries. In the U.S., that\\u2019s certainly been the case and cities have always evolved into something else. We have to accept that our downtowns are going to be something different. They cannot be monochromatic in terms of being dominated by office or commercial development; there has to be a blend of both. The solve is going to be different for different cities.\\n\\nSo, how can cities make downtowns more diverse, and have a different offering that doesn\\u2019t rely on traditional office space, and then also expand the hours between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., where it\\u2019s also not just relying on repopulating with a residential population? You have to have institutions and other cultural attractions that are going to continuously get people downtown. I think the biggest question is, how does your downtown survive when you do have emerging districts, that kind of shiny attraction that people and investors are going to run to?\\n\\n**Ian Mulcahey:** I think that the era of rigid zonal segregation is over. No longer can a city be simply divided into a series of discrete places: the place where I work, the place where I live, and the place where I want to spend my leisure time. This simplistic planning notion is about to change. People want to live in closer proximity to their work, and they want to be in an area that has theaters, museums, cinemas, shops, restaurants, cafes, and parks. The post-war planning consensus to separate these activities into different parts of the city and then construct complex high-capacity transport infrastructure to continually move the residents twice a day from one zone to the another is at an end.\\n\\nThe future of city planning will drive a more dispersed, nuanced approach to how we plan and manage our real estate. Workers don\\u2019t need to be concentrated in one big building in one city anymore. They can be in a number of cities and a number of neighbourhoods, but also in better locations. The [flight to quality](https://www.gensler.com/blog/how-desire-for-experience-is-driving-the-flight-to-quality) is very much still the priority, but now a high-quality living and working environment needs to be balanced by the quality of the urban land mix and high-quality urban transport system. The office certainly isn\\u2019t dead, and the city center isn\\u2019t dead, but is being redefined. The modern worker wants a better balance between their workstyle and lifestyle, and they want more choice, more variety, and much better public realm and open space.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re moving away from that notion of a workplace to thinking about how people work. So, in the same way we have been talking about lifestyle, we talk about workstyle, and also about a central business district being a [central social district](https://www.gensler.com/blog/union-square-san-francisco-social-district). The CBD becomes the CSD. So, the role of the city center is not just catering to office workers; it\\u2019s catering to everyone in the city. It\\u2019s a much more inclusive construct, but by default, that makes it a much more interesting place.\\n\\n\\u201cThe role of the city center is not just catering to office workers; it\\u2019s catering to everyone in the city. It\\u2019s a much more inclusive construct, but by default, that makes it a much more interesting place.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2014Ian Mulcahey, Cities & Urban Design leader\\n\\nThis is an aerial perspective of a modern building lobby featuring curved wooden architectural elements, a white geometric sculptural installation, a reception desk, waiting area seating, and marble flooring.\\n\\nCapital One McLean Block A aerial view\\n\\nDesign Forecast 2024\\n\\nExplore ideas, insights, and advice about commercial real estate and the building industry today and in the year to come.\\n\\n## How is the role of the master planner changing? What does a 21st Century approach for comprehensive master planning look like?\\n\\n**Chris Rzomp:** The era of the generalist master planner is over. We need to be able to provide comprehensive, specialized services that are very focused on economic development, resilience, and market forces. We need to be able to draw on our internal resources, as well as our external partners, to provide a hyper specialized approach to every project.\\n\\n**Andre:** Our practice has to be more flexible now than it ever was. One of the challenges and the opportunities that we have is that there\\u2019s no one project that is the same; we have to approach every project differently. We have to be very nimble, and a lot more flexible than we ever have been in our profession in offering the services that our clients need for a particular effort or project.\\n\\n## What\\u2019s driving this increased need for flexibility in city planning and design?\\n\\n**Andre:** Uncertainty in the current market, as well as future market forces, is driving this need for flexibility. A lot of the work that we do involves the intersection of the public and private sectors, where there are changing policies that we may have to adhere to that might change our approach to a masterplan. There are market conditions that developers who we\\u2019re working with are going to have to go through \\u2014 whether it\\u2019s entitlements, or speed to execute an entitlement process that forces us to be more nimble \\u2014 that go beyond simply designing a project.\\n\\n**Ian:** We\\u2019ve focused quite a bit over recent months on the [repositioning of office buildings](https://www.gensler.com/blog/what-we-learned-assessing-office-to-residential-conversions), and clearly there\\u2019s going to be a lot more of that. But there\\u2019s also the repositioning of everything \\u2014 converting old power stations, factories, and retail centers \\u2014 this kind of repurposing and repositioning of the city is something very interesting. This also plays into resilience; rather than knocking down and removing an asset, why not reinvent and repurpose it? People can work where they live, and they can live where they used to work.\\n\\n**Andre:** Whether you\\u2019re [decommissioning a coal fired power plant](https://www.gensler.com/case-study/avon-lake-renewable-master-plan), or a regulatory process for taking down a public housing site, or repurposing an aging piece of infrastructure into something different \\u2014 it goes beyond just design; it speaks to policy speaks of regulations that we have to adhere to that really influence how we are able to do our work. And that requires expertise, and sometimes involves other practice areas and consultants.\\n\\n**Chris:** We recently won this competition for the [redevelopment of the Tropicana Field site](https://www.mlb.com/rays/news/rays-st-petersburg-ballpark-agreement) in St. Petersburg, Florida. It\\u2019s a huge urban transformational project, and we\\u2019re taking 80 acres surrounding this outdated stadium and creating a mixed-use, multigenerational, multi-income neighborhood. And we are working with the planning department to look at existing zoning and understand how to work within or amend the existing codes to get this implemented.\\n\\n**Ian:** In Europe, we\\u2019re also seeing that long-standing principles of zoning, planning, regulation, or controls are having to be rethought. The notion of a segregation of uses is giving way to a mix of various uses. And it\\u2019s both a product of a pandemic, but also gradual technological change that\\u2019s been enabling a different type of behavior. Just 10 or 15 years ago, it was all about what you were going to do with old industrial or port sites. And now, you\\u2019re looking at traditional CBDs, exaggerated to some extent by very tightly controlled zoning or planning policies, that are now having to be rethought and reinvented, it\\u2019s a very exciting time.\\n\\n**Chris:** When these big projects are reinvesting in downtowns with a mixed-use project or development, they really become the catalyst or vehicle for enforcing some of these changes and getting people to rethink about zoning as it\\u2019s been written.\\n\\n**Andre:** You see places like Minneapolis that have eliminated single family zoning, or cities like Birmingham, Alabama, that have eliminated parking standards. So, we have to be very much tuned into how a city policy is looking to reshape the built environment, and how we could respond to our clients who are looking to do the same.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have to be very much tuned into how a city policy is looking to reshape the built environment, and how we could respond to our clients who are looking to do the same.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2014Andre Brumfield, Cities & Urban Design leader\\n\\n## We\\u2019re seeing in Gensler\\u2019s City Pulse data that people don\\u2019t feel currently that their CBDs are a good place to raise children to start a family. Is there an opportunity to make downtowns more inclusive, more accessible, and more profitable?\\n\\n**Andre:** It\\u2019s not just a downtown phenomenon. Our cities have gotten a lot more expensive. When people make choices once their kids reach a certain age, they often ask: Do I stay in the city or go to the suburbs? And that is the tipping point for how cities actually lose citizens who have strong tax base, how they lose a consistent population, and that impacts services that we can all benefit from, whether it\\u2019s public transportation or other public amenities.\\n\\n**Chris:** The polycentric aspect of cities is a trend that\\u2019s going to continue. The neighborhood units of our cities are going to continue to get stronger as more people seek that workstyle and stay closer to home. We will start to see these neighborhood centers popping up, growing, and thriving more than they had in the past.\\n\\n**Ian:** We\\u2019re definitely seeing that in the U.K. If you go into what was the financial center, it\\u2019s still very quiet at times, as parts of the city are dominated by people working there 3 or 4 days a week, and then you go into some of the neighborhoods further out in London, and they\\u2019re just full of people, and there\\u2019s lots going on. Since the pandemic, Saturday is still the busiest day of the week on the metro.\\n\\n**Chris:** Open space is also vital in order to reimagine a city\\u2019s downtown. People understood the value of open space during the pandemic and being able to have these places outside your buildings where indoor and outdoor space blends. That interconnected and active ground plane throughout downtown is going to become a differentiator.\\n\\n\\u201cOpen space is also vital in order to reimagine a city\\u2019s downtown\\u2026. That interconnected and active ground plane throughout downtown is going to become a differentiator.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2014Chris Rzomp, Cities & Urban Design leader\\n\\n## How can we help solve for affordable and workplace housing, and what are some of the barriers and obstacles to addressing these issues?\\n\\n**Ian:** There\\u2019s a [shortage of housing](https://www.gensler.com/podcasts/attainable-and-affordable-housing) everywhere, whether it\\u2019s in the Middle East or in Europe. Certainly, what we\\u2019re seeing in the U.K. is that the more regulatory systems we put in place to force developers to provide a proportion or a quantity of affordable housing within a development, the more that has actually slowed down the rate of overall development, and paradoxically, led to a shortage. So, the market then grinds to a halt because people can\\u2019t move and trade up, which means there\\u2019s a whole underclass who won\\u2019t get any housing. So, encouraging supply, whether publicly or privately provided, is going to come back into the frame again, because that\\u2019s really the only way you\\u2019re going to make housing more affordable for everyone.\\n\\n**Andre:** There are three options to solve for. Either the government is going to step in, through local housing authorities or agencies, or the private sectors are going to be part of the solution, or both. And it varies from country to country and from city to city. These components go beyond what urban designers and planners do, but we know the issues that are slowing down real viable solutions to bring about change.\\n\\nWe have relationships with a number of housing authorities, as well as developers who focus on affordable housing. And I think the opportunity now is to ask, how do we go beyond the regulatory or entitlement process to really bring our design lens, from an architecture standpoint, to make these plans real?\\n\\n## How do cities need to adapt to the realities of climate change?\\n\\n**Chris:** We\\u2019re looking at how climate change impacts livability in urban areas. There is a certain aspect of [climate justice](https://www.gensler.com/blog/climate-justice-in-projects-engaging-community-partners) that is almost becoming table stakes in any urban project. And we\\u2019re doing a lot of work in Baltimore right now, and especially in the more disinvested neighborhoods, the temperatures can be up to five to seven degrees higher than areas that have dense tree cover, and that effect is disproportionately put on lower income populations. We need to correct that as we move forward within our planning, to keep an eye on the effects that climate change can have on these neighborhoods if we\\u2019re not actively making changes there through the public realm.\\n\\nIn terms of mitigation, there are measures we can take. We\\u2019re doing some work on [Harborplace in Baltimore](https://www.gensler.com/press-releases/reimagined-baltimore-harborplace-renderings), and just understanding that, when we\\u2019re planning for a public realm for the next 50 years, that it\\u2019s going to look very different, so we have to get ahead of that. And it\\u2019s about looking at these resilient systems that will be able to change, adapt, and grow with it.\\n\\nFor media inquiries, email [media@gensler.com](https://www.gensler.com/blog/).\"\n",

Photo by Ben Rahn/A-Frame.\\n\\nOver the course of my 30-year long career as a retail designer, I\\u2019ve seen more than my fair share of ups-and-downs. Numerous recessions, a pandemic, and the birth of one key disruption that is now long considered unimaginable to live without. Like in fashion, trends come and go, but the recurring notion that in-store shopping is dead has continued to plague brick-and-mortar retail since the inception of the e-tail \\u2014 a headline that\\u2019s as played out as the \\u201cBedazzler.\\u201d In reality, in-store shopping is alive and well, but not all retail experiences are created equal.\\n\\nDespite the convenience of online shopping, there is something irreplaceable about the in-store experience. Only in-store can customers compare fabrics, try on for size, shop socially, or simply have the opportunity to stumble upon something new or unexpected. While there are exceptions, algorithms usually don\\u2019t lead shoppers to an adrenaline rush from stumbling upon a great discovery! But while in-store shopping is inimitable in the digital realm, it hinges on its ability to accurately reflect a brand, connect with customers, and offer a seamless journey through space, and it starts with deliberate, bespoke, and often bold design decisions.\\n\\nWith experience on both sides of the fence \\u2014 having worked in retail for 10 years \\u2014 it\\u2019s no surprise to me when retailers become cautious around designing a new store, especially when considering escalating construction costs and the drastic changes in customer behaviour and technology in recent years. Unfortunately, it\\u2019s this fear-based mentality that leads clients to want to be all things to all people, spurring the creation of cookie-cutter like spaces, generic experiences, and the deterioration of in-store brand identity \\u2014 the antithesis of positive customer experiences.\\n\\nTo help my clients avoid fear-based decision making at every stage of the design process, I always ask them three key questions:\\n\\n## How will the space reflect the brand?\\n\\nA strong brand isn\\u2019t meant to appeal to everyone, it should have an impact on the people it resonates with. Think of your favourite restaurants. How similar are they to their competitors? Chances are, they\\u2019re quite different, and this is how I encourage my clients to think about retail spaces. To move away from overly cautious design choices, I advise my clients to view the in-store space as a reflection of their brand\\u2019s uniqueness. As seen with [Simons](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/simons-bets-on-the-future-of-canadian-retail-by-opening-two-new-urban-toronto-stores-in-2025-842873193.html), which is working to open 228,000 square feet of space across two new stores in Toronto, understanding the brand is crucial in curating the experience for a new customer base, and to increase brand recognition. For the Quebec-City based retailer, this includes Simons\\u2019 signature use of works by local artists and nature-inspired design elements.\\n\\nThis is an architectural rendering of a multi-story building with a Simons department store and a Cucina restaurant, showcasing a modern design with varying facade textures, large windows, and prominent signage.\\n\\nSimons Eaton Centre, Toronto\\n\\n## How will the space connect with customers?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s at this stage where I most often encounter fear-based decision making, especially when a client becomes weary of making bold design decisions for fear of alienating customers, without realizing that watered down design is equally as effective at turning people away.\\n\\nHelping clients understand how their space connects with their customers is crucial. While there is a method to the madness, any designer would be lying to you if they claimed it\\u2019s an exact science \\u2014 another cause for cautious design choices. What\\u2019s important is that the design offers a point of view. Having designed nine previous Simons stores over 25 years, it\\u2019s about bringing Simons\\u2019 fashion-forward, democratic approach to retail to a new audience.\\n\\n## How can the space become a journey?\\n\\nBut even if the store is an accurate reflection of the brand and manages to connect with customers on a human-level, shoppers cannot be expected to stay in a space that is bereft of logic, especially if it\\u2019s a larger retail environment. Instead, the space must entice shoppers to linger, explore, and understand the ecosystem of interconnected spaces and experiences.\\n\\nA strategic design approach will consider the curation of space into digestible vignettes and product moments, providing a narrative thread for customers to venture from one experience to another \\u2014 like breadcrumbs, shoppers should be led on a journey.\\n\\nThe photograph shows a modern retail space with a pink velvet curved sofa, a light stone coffee table, a unique swirling rug, and clothing racks in front of a softly lit, draped backdrop, accented with green plants and stylish accessories, all under bright track lighting.\\n\\nHolt Renfrew\\u2019s The Studio, Toronto.

Photo by Stephanie Kretzschmer.\\n\\nWhen it comes to retail, there is so much that is out of our control as designers. We cannot alter the products our clients sell, the people they hire, or anything that happens outside of the store, but good design can still have an incredible impact. For many consumers, a store is still the most tangible visual cue for many brands. How the space reflects the brand, connects with customers, and provides an experience that will entice them to explore and keep shopping are all influenced by design.\\n\\nAs we learned during the pandemic, people still crave positive in-store shopping experiences. What\\u2019s more, if brick-and-mortar shopping had truly died alongside its first \\u2014 of many \\u2014 painstaking obituaries, I wouldn\\u2019t have had a very long career. Yet, I can recall a time working in retail when credit cards weren\\u2019t tapped so much as they were railroaded by something colloquially referred to as a \\u201cknuckle-buster,\\u201d and I\\u2019m still designing retail spaces. While everything evolves, some things never change.\\n\\nFor media inquiries, email [media@gensler.com](https://www.gensler.com/blog/).\"\n",

       "When designing for a return to the office space, it's important to consider several key issues to create an environment that supports both individual and team productivity, as well as employee satisfaction. Here are five issues to think about:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **The Evolving Role of the Office:** Understand that the primary reason people come to the office has shifted from in-person collaboration to focusing on individual work [1]. Employees now value the office for access to technology, specific spaces, materials, and resources that help them get their work done [1]. Therefore, the design should cater to these needs by providing focus areas and ensuring that necessary tools and resources are readily available.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Balancing Collaboration and Individual Work:** Recognize the importance of both collaboration and individual focus. While companies want employees to return to the office for collaboration, decreasing collaboration spaces in favor of individual workstations can be counterproductive [2]. Aim for a \"both/and\" approach that supports both individual focus and rich collaborative work to deliver better experiences and stronger cultures [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Creating a Mix of Experiences:** Employees are more willing to return to the office if their ideal work experience mix is provided [1]. Consider incorporating a variety of spaces, ranging from library-like quiet zones to coffee shop-style social areas, to cater to different work styles and preferences [1]. By offering a mix of experiences, companies can encourage employees to come in more often.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Design spaces that are flexible and can adapt to changing needs. The real estate industry is in a time of great uncertainty, so designing for resilience means creating environments suited to how we work and live, two variables that are constantly changing [3]. Mixed-use environments are key to reviving communities’ urban centers [3]. This may involve creating multi-use spaces or ensuring that the layout can be easily reconfigured to accommodate different team sizes or project requirements.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Reflecting the Brand and Connecting with Customers:** Ensure that the office space reflects the company's brand and connects with employees on a human level [5]. The design should offer a point of view and create a seamless journey through the space, enticing employees to linger, explore, and understand the ecosystem of interconnected spaces and experiences [5]. This can be achieved through deliberate, bespoke design decisions that capture the brand's uniqueness and create a positive in-store shopping experiences [5].\n",
