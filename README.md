# Project-Bridge-AEC-RAG

## Project Background

This project originated as part of the **Google Gen AI Intensive Course (March 31 - April 4, 2025)** hosted on Kaggle. The challenge: apply core Generative AI concepts â€” including document/image understanding, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), structured outputs, and function calling â€” to tackle a real-world problem.

Our focus: addressing the **data fragmentation crisis** in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry by building a **smart information retrieval system** tailored to AEC needs.

## Problem Statement

The AEC industry, projected to surpass **$10 trillion by 2030** (Oxford Economics, 2021), remains one of the least digitized sectors. Key challenges include:

- Highly **fragmented project value chains**
- **Transient project teams**
- **Chronically low R&D spending** (McKinsey, 2019)
- **96% of project data remains unused** (FMI Corporation, 2018)
- **13% of professional time** is spent searching for project information, costing an estimated **$88 billion annually** in avoidable rework (Autodesk & FMI, 2021)

Despite producing vast amounts of data (e.g., BIM models, RFIs, job-site photos), AEC firms struggle to make knowledge easily accessible when and where it matters most.

## Solution Overview

We built a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that:

- **Ingests** text and visual project knowledge
- **Embeds** and stores content in **semantic vector databases** (ChromaDB)
- **Retrieves** relevant data based on user queries
- **Generates** grounded, structured responses using Google's **Gemini 2.0 Flash** model
- Supports **multimodal retrieval** â€” both text **and** images
- Uses **function calling** to dynamically route queries to appropriate retrieval or generation tools

The proof-of-concept shows how AEC professionals can:

- Find precedents or design details during meetings
- Access cost metrics or space planning data instantly
- Draft proposals and reports faster
- Empower new team members with self-service knowledge access

## Phase 1: First Prototype (Completed)

The Phase 1 implementation includes:

- A working multimodal RAG system demonstrated on **AEC thought leadership content** (using the [Gensler Research Library](https://www.gensler.com/research-library))
- Integration of AI-based image captioning and OCR for richer visual context
- Function-calling powered intelligent retrieval workflows
- Examples of article generation via few-shot prompting
- Structured JSON outputs for consistent formatting and citation control
