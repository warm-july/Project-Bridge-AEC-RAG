# Project Bridge: Bridging the Gap in Data Fragmentation for AEC with AI-Powered Knowledge Retrieval

> **Project Background**
> 
> This capstone project stems from the 5-day **Google Gen AI Intensive Course** (March 31 - April 4, 2025) hosted on Kaggle. It explores applying Gen AI capabilities â€” including document/image understanding, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), structured outputs, and function calling â€” to address a real-world challenge in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry: creating a **smart information retrieval system**.

## Why: The Problem Statement

The AEC industry, projected to surpass **$10 trillion by 2030** (Oxford Economics, 2021), remains one of the least digitized sectors. Key challenges include:

- Highly **fragmented project value chains**
- **Transient project teams**
- **Chronically low R&D spending** (McKinsey, 2019)
- **96% of project data remains unused** (FMI Corporation, 2018)
- Professionals spend **13% of their time searching** for project information, causing **$88 billion** in annual rework losses (Autodesk & FMI, 2021)

Despite generating mountains of data â€” BIM models, RFIs, photos â€” much of it gets siloed, buried, or lost.

> _What if AI could surface the right knowledge at the right moment, grounded in real project data, for real-time project needs?_

That led us to build a proof-of-concept: a **multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** tailored for the AEC industry.

## What: The Solution

At its core, the solution leverages **RAG**: a combination of semantic search and generative AI.

![Framework](static/Framework.png)
**Figure 1.** How a query flows through a retrieval-augmented generation system.

Rather than relying solely on pretraining, the LLM dynamically retrieves relevant project-specific content, grounds its responses, and generates targeted answers. Recognizing that AEC knowledge is highly visual, our system supports both text and image retrieval.

Teams can now ask:

- _"What are five design strategies for revitalizing retail corridors?"_
- _"Show me examples of residential buildings with public plazas."_

And receive grounded, visual-rich answers from their internal knowledge base â€” within seconds.

### 1. Data Ingestion & Enrichment

Content was ingested from real-world sources like the [Gensler Research Library](https://www.gensler.com/research-library), including:

- Articles, reports, and case studies
- Diagrams, project photos, and visual collateral
- Metadata (titles, captions, source URLs)

![Example ingestion](static/Pasted%20image%2020250420021533.png)
**Figure 3.** Example of structured ingestion and enrichment.

Images underwent AI-powered captioning, OCR, and multi-layered description generation using Gemini Vision models.

**Figure 4.** Rich visual descriptions generated automatically.

### 2. Embedding and Dual Vector Storage

Text and enriched visual data were embedded into semantic vectors using Gemini models and stored into two parallel **ChromaDB** collections.

![Embedding Workflow](static/Embedding.png)
**Figure 5.** Embedding pipeline for scalable multimodal knowledge bases.

This structure enables either text-first, image-first, or hybrid retrieval depending on the query.

### 3. Autonomous Function Calling and Retrieval

Using Gemini's **function calling**, natural language queries are routed automatically to appropriate actions:

- Querying articles
- Searching images
- Summarizing with sources
- Generating new images or articles

![Function call demo](static/Pasted%20image%2020250420023531.png)
**Figure 6.** Gemini recognizes when to trigger search vs. generation.

### 4. Structured Output and Markdown Rendering

Structured JSON outputs ensure:

- Clear answers with accurate citations
- Consistent visual layout
- Easy extension into custom UIs

## Use Cases

If developed fully, systems like this could revolutionize knowledge access in AEC:

- **Instant Precedent Search:** Find detailed examples for design reviews and meetings.
- **Planning Insights:** Access historical cost data, space planning ratios, or zoning precedents.
- **Proposal and Report Drafting:** Accelerate content creation by using existing knowledge foundations.
- **Onboarding and Training:** Help new hires explore standards and best practices independently.

Ultimately, this helps bridge internal silos, surface insights faster, and empower more consistent, innovative project delivery.

## What's Next: Future Development

Building on this proof-of-concept, planned extensions include:

- **Advanced Retrieval:**
  - Metadata-filtered and weighted ranking
  - Live access to project management and BIM platforms via APIs
- **Expanded Ingestion:**
  - PDFs, scanned documents, intranet wikis
  - Auto-summarization for CAD/BIM metadata
- **Intelligence Enhancements:**
  - Agentic multi-step workflows
  - Specialized embeddings (e.g., Doc2Vec, visual-tactile fusion)
