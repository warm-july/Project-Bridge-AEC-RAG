## Planned Structure

- `main.py` — Main entry point for the web server (e.g., FastAPI or Flask app).
- `routes/` — Subfolder for organizing different API endpoints or web routes.
- `services/` (optional) — Business logic for retrieval, generation, and AI integration.
- `models/` (optional) — Classes or utilities related to data models, not AI models.

## Goals

- Serve RAG-powered knowledge retrieval endpoints.
- Integrate AI responses into a user-friendly API or frontend.
- Transition from prototype (notebook) to scalable application.

This folder will gradually replace exploratory notebooks as the project evolves into a full software system.
